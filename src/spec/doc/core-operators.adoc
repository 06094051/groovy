= Operators

This chapter covers the operators of the Groovy programming language.

== Arithmetic operators

Groovy supports the usual familiar arithmetic operators you find in mathematics and in other programming languages like Java.
All the Java arithmetic operators are supported. Let's go through them in the following examples.

=== Normal arithmetic operators

The following binary arithmetic operators are available in Groovy:

[cols="1,1,1" options="header"]
|====
| Operator
| Purpose
| Remarks

| +++
| addition
|

| +-+
| substraction
|

| +*+
| multiplication
|

| +/+
| division
| Use +intdiv()+ for integer division, and see the section about <<core-syntax.adoc#integer_division,the integer division>> for more information on the return type of the division.

| +%+
| modulo
|

| +**+
| power
| See the section about <<core-syntax.adoc#power_operator,the power operation>> for more information on the return type of the operation.

Here are a few examples of usage of those operators:
