= Operators

This chapter covers the operators of the Groovy programming language.

== Arithmetic operators

Groovy supports the usual familiar arithmetic operators you find in mathematics and in other programming languages like Java.
All the Java arithmetic operators are supported. Let's go through them in the following examples.

=== Normal arithmetic operators

The following binary arithmetic operators are available in Groovy:

[cols="1,1,1" options="header"]
|====
| Operator
| Purpose
| Remarks

| +++
| addition
|

| +-+
| substraction
|

| +*+
| multiplication
|

| +/+
| division
| Use +intdiv()+ for integer division, and see the section about <<core-syntax.adoc#integer_division,the integer division>> for more information on the return type of the division.

| +%+
| modulo
|

| +**+
| power
| See the section about <<core-syntax.adoc#power_operator,the power operation>> for more information on the return type of the operation.
|====

Here are a few examples of usage of those operators:

[source,groovy]
----
include::{projectdir}/src/spec/test/OperatorsTest.groovy[tags=binary_arith_ops,indent=0]
----

=== Unary operators

The +++ and +-+ operators are also available as unary operators:

[source,groovy]
----
include::{projectdir}/src/spec/test/OperatorsTest.groovy[tags=unary_plus_minus,indent=0]
----
<1> Note the usage of parentheses to surround an expression to apply the unary minus to that surrounded expression.

In terms of unary arithmetics operators, the ++++ (increment) and +--+ (decrement) operators are available, 
both in prefix and postfix notation:

[source,groovy]
----
include::{projectdir}/src/spec/test/OperatorsTest.groovy[tags=plusplus_minusminus,indent=0]
----
<1> The postfix increment will increment +a+ after the expression has been evaluated and assigned into +b+
<2> The postfix decrement will decrement +c+ after the expression has been evaluated and assigned into +d+
<3> The prefix increment will increment +e+ before the expression is evaluated and assigned into +f+
<4> The prefix decrement will decrement +g+ before the expression is evaluated and assigned into +h+

=== Assignment arithmetic operators

From the binary arithmetic operators we have seen above, certain of them are also available in an assignment form:

* ++=+
* +-=+
* +*=+
* +/=+
* +%=+

Let's see them in action:

[source,groovy]
----
include::{projectdir}/src/spec/test/OperatorsTest.groovy[tags=binary_assign_operators,indent=0]
----

== Relational operators

Relational operators allow comparisons between objects, to know if two objects are the same or different,
or if one is greater or lower than or equal to the other.

The following operators are available:

[cols="1,1" options="header"]
|====
| Operator
| Purpose

| +==+
| equal

| +!=+
| different

| +<+
| less than

| `<=`
| less than or equal

| +>+
| greater than

| +>=+
| greater than or equal
|====

These operators into action in simple number comparisons:

[source,groovy]
----
include::{projectdir}/src/spec/test/OperatorsTest.groovy[tags=simple_relational_op,indent=0]
----

== Logical operators

Groovy offers three logical operators for boolean expressions:

* `&&`: logical "and"
* `||`: logical "or"
* `!`: logical "not"

Let's illustrate them with the following examples:

[source,groovy]
----
include::{projectdir}/src/spec/test/OperatorsTest.groovy[tags=logical_op,indent=0]
----
<1> "not" false is true
<2> true "and" true is true
<3> true "or" false is true

=== Precedence

The logical "not" has a higher priority than the logical "and".

[source,groovy]
----
include::{projectdir}/src/spec/test/OperatorsTest.groovy[tags=logical_precendence_1,indent=0]
----
<1> Here, the assertion is true, because "not" has a higher precedence than "and", otherwise, the assertion would have failed

The logical "and" has a higher priority than the logical "or".

[source,groovy]
----
include::{projectdir}/src/spec/test/OperatorsTest.groovy[tags=logical_precendence_2,indent=0]
----
<1> Here, the assertion is true, because "and" has a higher precedence than "or", otherwise, the assertion would have failed

=== Short-circuiting for `||`

The logical "or" operator is supporting short-circuiting: if the left operand is true, it won't evaluate the right operand.
The right operand will be evaluated only if the left operand is false.

[source,groovy]
----
include::{projectdir}/src/spec/test/OperatorsTest.groovy[tags=logical_or_shortcircuit,indent=0]
----
<1> We create a function that returns its boolean argument, but it sets the `called` flag 
<2> In the first case, we confirm that the function is not called, as `||` short-circuits the evaluation of the right operand.
<3> In the second case, the right operand is called, as indicated by the fact our flag is now true


== Bitwise operators

Groovy offers 4 bitwise operators:

* `&`: bitwise "and"
* `|`: bitwise "or"
* `^`: bitwise "xor" (exclusive "or")
* `~`: bitwise negation

Bitwise operators can be applied on a `byte` or an `int` and return an `int`:

[source,groovy]
----
include::{projectdir}/src/spec/test/OperatorsTest.groovy[tags=bitwise_op,indent=0]
----
<1> bitwise and
<2> bitwise and returns common bits
<3> bitwise or
<4> bitwise or returns all '1' bits
<5> setting a mask to check only the last 8 bits
<6> bitwise exclusive or on self returns 0
<7> bitwise exclusive or
<8> bitwise negation

It's worth noting that the internal representation of primitive types follow the http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-4.html[Java Language Specification]. In particular,
primitive types are signed, meaning that for a bitwise negation, it is always good to use a mask to retrieve only the necessary bits.

In Groovy, bitwise operators have the particularity of being <<Operator-Overloading,overloadable>>, meaning that you can define the behavior of those operators for any kind of object.
